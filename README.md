Welcome to PetCare Website!
The PetCare website is a full stack web application that helps pet owners manage their pets needs. The project structure is organised in order, with critical components distributed across folders. The 'views' folder contains EJS files that render dynamic content, whereas the 'public' directory has a'resources' folder with subdirectories for styles, scripts, and images, ensuring efficient asset management. 'server.js' manages the basic functionality by managing routes, connecting to MongoDB Atlas using a specific connection string, and retrieving data from the database. This structured arrangement ensures versatility and scalability, allowing for future enhancements and maintenance of the PetCare website.
To run this web application in terminal run node server and you will get to see the following message 
"Connected to MongoDB Atlas
Server is running on port 5000"
Then in browser run this page rendering route that will direct you to homepage "http://localhost:5000/homepage" and from their you will be able to view About, Caretype, Description, Crud, FAQ and ContactUs  pages OR to view pages individually you can place this http://localhost:5000/homepage with any of these page rendering routes just change /homepage with /About, /Caretype, /Description, /Crud, /FAQ and /ContactUs. 
This is how you will be able to visit the Pet Care website.
